Description: Linux SCSI target user-space daemon and tools
 The Linux target framework (tgt) allows a Linux system to provide SCSI
 devices (targets) over networked SCSI transports.
 .
 tgt consists of a user-space daemon and user-space tools currently
 supporting the following transports:
 .
  - iSCSI (SCSI over IP)
  - iSER (iSCSI over RDMA, using Infiniband)
 .
 tgt also supports different storage types for use as backing stores for SCSI
 Logical Units:
 .
  - Plain files and block devices
  - Ceph/RADOS RBD volumes
  - GlusterFS volumes
 .
 This package includes the daemon and user-space tools.
